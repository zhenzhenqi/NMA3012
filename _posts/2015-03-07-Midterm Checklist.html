        <li>Styling Navbar across all pages</li>
        <p>If you want to implement a universal Navbar style across all pages, take out the entire nav tag section from the body and put it right below the head section, above the body section. Then, if you write css code once it will work on all pages. You can check out the code of an example I made here <a href="https://github.com/zhenzhenqi/COMP104demo/tree/gh-pages">https://github.com/zhenzhenqi/COMP104demo/tree/gh-pages</a> </p>
