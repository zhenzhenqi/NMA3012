title: Welcome to NMA3012 | Programming Interactivity 
---

<div>
    <h3>Course Description, goals and objectives</h3>
    <p>User input can affect a wide range of new media artworks that may include animation, sound, web projects, and robotics. In this hands-on introduction, students will learn techniques for harnessing analog and digital inputs to create responsive, interactive artworks. Students will explore functional, ethical, and aesthetic frameworks for interactivity; develop skills to conceptualize, code, and craft their own interactive projects; and discover how to apply digital interactivity in engaging, participatory artworks. Through projects, experiments, lectures, readings, and field trips, this course introduces New Media Arts students to programming and microcontrollers; no previous programming experience is necessary. Prerequisite: NMA 2050, Introduction to New Media Arts.</p>

    <h3>Textbooks</h3>
    <p>The main textbook for this class is <a href="http://media.espora.org/mgoblin_media/media_entries/407/Learning_Processing_-_A_Beginners_Guide_to_Programming_Images_Animation_and_Interaction_--_Daniel_Shiffman.pdf">Learning Processing.</a> Students with previous coding background are encouraged to read his more advanced series, <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a>by Daniel Shiffman.</p>
    <p>Excerpts from the book Multimedia - From Wagner to Virtual Reality will be assigned as reading assignments, and serve as reference for in-class discussions on the following week.</p>

    <h3>Instructor Contact</h3>
    <p>Feel free to email me at <strong>z@zzyw.media</strong> any time for questions. Please write <strong>NMA3012</strong> on the title of the email.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
    <p>Students are required to attend every session of their courses. Irregular attendance not only hurts a student's course work, but it weakens the class as a whole and is not permitted. Since this course has frequent in-class coding excercise, missing class will also affect your progress in the course. Attendance is recorded prior to every lecture, and students with excessive absences will be officially dropped from the course in accordance with College rules.
        <br><br>Arriving late interferes with other students' learning and is not acceptable. Repeated Late attendance will be counted absent.
        <br><br>All students are excused from absences with official doctor's note, and absences due to extreme weather conditions. Beyond two unexcused absences, highest achievable grade will be deducted by a grade level for each additional absence. For example, three unexcused absences will result in a B, and four a C. Beyond four absences, a WU grade will be automatically assigned and the student will be asked to stop participanting in any further in-class activities. Please see below for WU grade police quoted from Baruch College office of Registra website. 
        <br><br>"A WU grade must be given to freshman and sophomores for unexcused absence in excess of twice the number of weekly hours the class meets and may be given to juniors or seniors. A WU given prior to a student applying for a W takes precedence. A WU counts as an F grade in a student transcript. A WU grade may not be used if the student has taken the final examination
        <br><br>All cellphones and other electronic devices should be turned off at all times during lecture."
        </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <p>A coding assigment will be assigned after each lecture and collected at the begining of the following lecture. All students are requried to present their assigments to the rest of the class, articulating the conceptual, asthetic as well as technical aspect of the assignment.</p>
    <p>Homework should always be handed in at the beginning of the next week's lecture. Homework that is turned in after the deadline will not be accepted. Homework is an extremely important part of mastering the concept and development of new media art and interaction design. Students who consistently fail to turn in homework will be adviced to drop the class or given a WU grade.</p>
    <p>Save your homework in a folder that includes your first and last name, at the following location:</p>
    <p>FPA_Share=>Full Share=>3012 Qi=>HW+No.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Videos</h3>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists">Instruction Videos </a>are organized in accordance with each chapter of the book. Feel free to view them before the lectures, and/or after class to help review the weekly lessons.

<div>
    <h3>Final Project Proposal and Final Project</h3>
    <p>There will be a written final project proposal and a final project assignment for this class. In-class discussions sessions as well as individual group meetings will be held to help conceptualize the project idea, gather visual and technical reference.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Grades</h3>
    <p>Final grades will be calculated according to the following formula:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attendance and in-class contributions: 20%</li>
        <li>Homework: 50%</li>
        <li>Final Project Proposal: 10%</li>
        <li>Fina Project: 20%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Points will be converted to a total grade based on 100 available points and Baruchâ€™s published grade scale (in the following table). Grades falling on the boundary will be resolved to the higher grade. If, for any reason, total points are adjusted, your final grade is total points received divided by total points available.</p>
